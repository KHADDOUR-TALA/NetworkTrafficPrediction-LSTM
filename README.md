## Using AI/ML to Predict Network Traffic and Optimize Routing

This project explores the use of **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML)** to predict network traffic patterns and improve routing decisions in computer networks.

## Project Overview

**Field:** Robotics and Intelligent Systems Engineering

**University:** Manara University

**Focus:** Predicting network traffic using ML and applying it to dynamic routing

## Description

Traditional routing protocols react only to current network conditions, which can lead to inefficiencies under changing traffic loads.
In this project, an **LSTM-based machine learning model** is used to predict future network traffic. These predictions are then integrated into a **dynamic routing algorithm**.

The predictive routing approach is compared with:

* Reactive routing (based only on current traffic)

* Oracle routing (assumes perfect future knowledge)

## Tools & Technologies

1. Python

2. LSTM (Deep Learning)

3. NetworkX

4. PyTorch

5. Google Colab

## Key Findings

- The LSTM model accurately predicts traffic trends

- Predictive routing did not outperform reactive routing under low network load

- Results highlight the importance of routing cost function design when using ML predictions

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of ML-based traffic prediction for intelligent routing, while also showing the challenges of translating accurate predictions into better routing performance. It provides a foundation for future research in adaptive and autonomous networking systems.
